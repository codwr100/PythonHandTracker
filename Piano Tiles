//the first library In Piano tiles, we have 4 pixel, each one is black, we need to import a library to determine rgb color of black
import pyautogui
pyautogui.displayMousePosiion() // DISPLAYS POSITION MOUSE IS POINTING AT AND ITS RBG VALUE this helps us identify the excact rbg value of the black pixel
// when we pointed at a black pixel he rbg position displayed to us was RGB(0,0,0)
